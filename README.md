# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/). The majority of my solutions will be be quick and functional rather than pretty or efficient :wink:. Check out my couple of [solutions from last year](https://github.com/jake-walker/advent-of-code-2019).

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles. I decided to code mine in Python using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

## Usage

```
python3 -m pip install jupyterlab
python3 -m jupyterlab
```
